We used sequence-to-sequence machine translation model to achieve the task.</li> <li>Ultimately, the deep learning model did not perform as we expected. However, it could correct simple errors with a relatively small dataset.</li> <li>I built the model and chrome extension single-handedly. I also contributed to the website writing backend django codes.</li> </ul> <p> Github Link: <a href="">Automatic Grammar Checker</a> </p> </body></html>
