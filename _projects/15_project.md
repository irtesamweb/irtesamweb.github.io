<h3>Highlights</h3>
<ul>
    <li>This project was part of Software Engineering Lab course.</li>
    <li>We built a website with Django, an android app and a chrome extension.</li>
    <li>The grammar checker was trained on a public dataset containing pair of wrong and correct sentences. We used sequence-to-sequence machine translation model to achieve the task.</li>
    <li>Ultimately, the deep learning model did not perform as we expected. However, it could correct simple errors with a relatively small dataset.</li>
    <li>I built the model and chrome extension single-handedly. I also contributed to the website writing backend django codes.</li>
    
</ul>
