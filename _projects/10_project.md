<h3>Highlights</h3>
<ul>
    <li>We plan to understand the relation between smoking and DNA methylation(data obtained from Illumina 450k array). This
work is currently at a preliminary stage.</li>
    <li>Our primary plan is to build a machine learning model and then use SHAP or some other technique for understanding association of different CpG sites with smoking phenotype.</li>
    
</ul>
