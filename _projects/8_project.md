<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
With the development of deep learning, various
method have been adopted in Host Intrusion Detection System
or HIDS. However, the traditional methods of HIDS have been
proven to be vulnerable to higher number of false alarm. In this
study, we have proposed a novel hierarchical attention based
deep learning method of detection intrusion on a host. We have
evaluated our model on ADLF-LD, which is a collection of a trace
data of Linux system calls. We have tuned our modelâ€™s hyper
parameters to produce the optimum result, and our method has
successfully outperforms the existing methods
